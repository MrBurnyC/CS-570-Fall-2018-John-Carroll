"I wrote this code myself but I used example inout2.c from C
by Discovery by Foster. I also read the first couple of 
chapters of this book to learn the C language. As errors 
occured I often googled syntax and used websites like
stackoverflow.com and various other that lead me to 
fix my code."
I also emailed Dr. Caroll for help and hints on this program and 
he has given me very good help that has lead me to finish it. 

As of right now my code is finished, has no known bugs and 
does produce the correct output which has been verified
by the autograder.
