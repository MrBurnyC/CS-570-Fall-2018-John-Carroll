"I wrote this code myself but I used the p2.c outline 
 in the lecture notes to jump start my p2.c 
 As errors occured I often googled syntax and used websites like
 stackoverflow.com and various other that lead me to 
 fix my code." I also emailed Dr. Caroll for help and hints on this program and 
 he has given me very good help that has lead me to finish it. 

As of right now my code is finished, has no known bugs and 
does produce the correct output which has been verified
by the autograder.
