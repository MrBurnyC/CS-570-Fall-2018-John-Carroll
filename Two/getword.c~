/*getword.c  - is a lexical analyzer that meets the requirements
 *	       of Program 0.
 *
 * Class Info- Bernardo Cervantes , John Carroll, CS570 ,
 *	       Due: 9/17/18 @ 8PM
 *		 
 * Synopsis  - Takes input from the keyboard (stdin) or from
 * 	       Data1/input# and writes to the Storage array 
 *	       and returns a int back to p0.
 *
 * Objective - Returns the correct input back to p0 so that 
 *             p0 will print out the correct int and string
 *	       that is identical to the same output in the 
 *	       p0 prompt and the what autograder produces.
 *
