In Test 23, I added one mmore command to ~cs570/Data4/input55 (namely
/bin/rm -f your.output55
as the first line).  So the correct stdout/stderr text should be:
:570: :570: :570: p2 terminated.
However, the last run was still expecting one less command, which would
mean prompts of only
:570: :570: p2 terminated.
...and so the autograder  was often deducting two points where it shouldn't.
That issue will be fixed in tomorrow's run...

Cheers,
jc
