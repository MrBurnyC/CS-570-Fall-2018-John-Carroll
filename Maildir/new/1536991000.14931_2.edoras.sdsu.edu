You might want to peek ahead and find out how your documentation affected
your grade on p0, but then come back and read WHY you might no longer
have a score of 8/8.

This grading announcement contains common information sent to all students,
with ONE exception:  [only] the last line of this message is individualized;
make sure YOUR name appears below.  If your name is not on the last line of
this message, notify me immediately; it means I have incorrect records.

This is also a good time to remind you that I've updated the ~cs570/calendar
file with all the program1 and program2 deadlines:

CS570 Program1	Monday, September 17  (the standard 11pm deadline)
CS570 Program2	Friday, October 5     (11pm 115% deadline)
CS570 Program2	Wednesday, October 10 (11pm 100% deadline

There are several lines below, and as assignments are recorded, the first
few lines will track the class averages and the high scores, to help you
judge how you are doing.  The entry for account masc0000, ostensibly owned by
Aaron Aardvark (the first name in computing...), will be used to record the
maximum possible points for a given assignment.  That line should appear just
above the line with your name on it.

Below are the grade totals for Program 0.  At the moment, the 'Total'
column is rather uninteresting, since we are only adding up the p0 score.
The '%' column translates this into a percentage (based on the "Perfect
Score" point total shown).  What you see below is what I have recorded in my
gradebook (i.e., it is the score that counts).  Check with me (in my office)
if you think it is wrong.

Since the p0 autograder had to award you 100% (8/8) on p0 to remain
registered in the course, the class average for the survivors is quite high.
...but not 100%; you could be docked as many as 3 points.  [But remember,
losing points *now* does NOT affect your enrollment in CS570; the fact
that you are reading this means that you did not get dropped!]

To adjust your p0 score, I checked the autograder output for 3 things.

[1] I checked whether you had BOTH of the required statements ('wrote it
myself' and 'no bugs') in gradernotes, and

[2] I also checked your documentation.  Ideally, you should have a
paragraph synopsis at the top of each function explaining the point
of the function.  A few people had something misleading (e.g.,
"getword() reads words until it finds EOF" -- that might be a good
description of p0.c, but you're describing what getword() does, not
what p0 does).

[3] You should also have some comments scattered through the code,
especially at decision points.  For the 'scattered comments', I simply did
ONE spot-check: Did you say WHY you needed to use ungetc()?  (A comment
saying merely that you put it back is useless; a reader of you code might
wonder WHY it needed to be read a second time, so this should have been
explained.  Saying merely that you put it back is like commenting
z++ with "Increment z" -- that is already clear from the code, the
issue is WHY z needed to be incremented.)

(If you are still unsure why you were docked points after reviewing
Thursday's output, definitely check with me -- perhaps I made a mistake
in grading...)  [To save paper, I'll likely have a similar grading regimen
for p1, but for our more complicated projects (p2, p3, and p4), I'll be
printing out the ENTIRE autograder output, marking it up, and handing it
back with extensive comments.]

When I check documentation in Program1, I will likely use very similar
criteria to determine your documentation points.

Some observations which might help in future documentation:  A comment for
        if (count == 0)
should NOT be something like: //check if count is zero
since that's obvious and uninformative.  Say WHY you're checking, e.g.,
       // See if we have a leading or trailing space

Note that for p1, our One/getword.h contains extensive specs, so there's no
need to repeat allllll that stuff; except for a short synopsis at the top,
your getword.c comments should be indicating *how* you implemented those
specs rather than regurgitating them all again.

The lines below the header line show the class average, maximum achieved,
maximum possible, and your score.
