Folks,
The department had a bit of an emergency this afternoon, and I was
recruited to help solve it.  So my 4pm class got cancelled, and I
won't be having my typical 5:20pm office hour tonight (December 4).
Things will resume as normal on Thursday, and I'll try to catch up
on my email next.  So if there were things you needed to discuss at
my evening office hour, try emailing me instead.

Cheers,
jc
