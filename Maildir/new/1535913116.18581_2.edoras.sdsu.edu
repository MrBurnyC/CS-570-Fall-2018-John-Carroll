Greetings (potential) CS570 students,
A fair number of people have just been evaluated by the autograder
as earning 8/8, so those students have demonstrated 'Knowledge of C'
and can remain enrolled.

(Note that that does not guarantee an 8/8 in my gradebook!  Once the
deadline has passed, I may downgrade some scores for lack of documentation,
deficiencies in the gradernotes file, etc. -- but you'll still remain
enrolled in the class, as long as [at least] one of the autograder tests
reported 8/8.)

The autograder runs for the last time at 8pm on Wednesday; you must
have your code working perfectly by then.  There will be two more
autograder preliminary runs, at what you ought to regard as random times.
But there is a high probability that the third run will be late
tonight or early Monday morning.

Cheers,
jc
