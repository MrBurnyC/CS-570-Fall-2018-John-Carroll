Below are the grade totals for the midterm exam (in the far right column,
labelled "E1").  The midterm score is NOT combined with the totals for the
assignments, and is NOT reflected in the percent (%) column, since a point
on the midterm is not quite worth the same as a point on an assignment.
The % column is just the average of your program scores, which now
incorporates p2.  At the end of the course, scores will be adjusted
to reflect the 30%/25%/45% split advertised in the syllabus for the
assignments/midterm/final weights.  The final is already worth 45% of your
grade, but if you do SIGNIFICANTLY better on the final than on the midterm,
I'll weight the final even more heavily, to help boost your grade.  Start
studying NOW, and remember that you need to concentrate on understanding,
not just memorization.

The average on the exam was 37/50 (74%) on the exam, despite some extremely
low scores, which may be an historic high -- so either this was an easy
exam, or you folks are REALLY good.

Getting more than 100% on the programs can help make up for any points you
might have missed on the midterm or final.  It's important to strive for
the 125% deadline for P4 (which will be worth a lot [about 50 points],
and will build on P2 -- so be thinking about how to fix anything that
still doesn't work in P2).  You're likely to be very busy at the end of
the semester, so getting P4 out of the way early can help in your other
classes, too -- and you get extra credit, to boot, WITHOUT extra work.
Pay attention to the P3 deadlines as well, and score some extra points there.
The quicker you finish P3, the quicker you can get started on P4.

The lines below show the class average, maximum achieved, maximum possible,
and your score.  If you requested a regrade on some exam problem[s], you
should see any such modifications reported below.
