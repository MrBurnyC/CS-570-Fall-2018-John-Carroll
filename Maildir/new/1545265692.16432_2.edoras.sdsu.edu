Below are the CS570 final exam grades, totals, and your course grade.
To the right of your name you will find the headings:

Total % E1 Fi C% Grade

The first Total and Percentage (%) columns are just for the sum of the programs.
E1 is the same as before, and represents the midterm exam score (out of 50);
the column (labeled 'Fi') shows your score on the final.

The next Percentage column (C%) is the cumulative weighted percent of the
three main components of the course (following the advertised 30% / 25% / 45%
weightings), followed by your letter grade for the course (under the
'Grade' column).  The letter grade should match what you see via WebGrades.

The formula I used to compute course percentages to achieve
the advertised 30%/25%/45% weightings of assignments/midterm/final is:
0.30*"%" + 2*0.25*E1 + 0.45*Fi = C%

Also, if you did *substantially* better on the final than on the midterm,
you might see a higher letter grade than was predicted by your course
percentage.  I also fudged the advertised 90/80/70/60 cutoffs a bit:
86% was enough for an A-, and you could dip as low as 54% and still get a
D- rather than the threatened F.  [And D- IS a PASSING grade; it satisfies
requirements at SDSU; just don't expect to be able to transfer those units
to another institution!]

Along with the extra credit from the programs, the course average (among
'active' students) is 73%, which is right around where a 'C' should be.

I'll be teaching classes [probably the same ones!] next fall, but I'm not
teaching this spring; perhaps I'll see some of you next fall (or at the
May graduation for those of you who will be gone by then).

You're welcome to come by my office and look at your final in the fall.
(I'll be keeping all the finals, but you're welcome to come to my office
to visit yours for a while.)

My office hours will resume about the time classes start up in the fall,
but I'll still be answering email [including advising questions] daily
during the winter break, spring, and summer break.

Have a good break,
jc
