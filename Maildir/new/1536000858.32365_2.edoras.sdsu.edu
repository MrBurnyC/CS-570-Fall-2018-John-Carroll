This is a **preliminary** test of your upcoming Program 0.

Due dates for our programs can be found in the ~cs570/calendar file on edoras.

Success on this assignment determines your competency in C, and whether or
not you will be disenrolled from CS570 for lack of prerequisites.

This message, which will appear to be mailed from your account, is intended to
show you the checks that will be made on your assignment when the due date
actually arrives.  This is NOT the actual version that will be graded,
but only an attempt to give you early warning of any potential problems.
Point totals in the final graded version may differ.

[Standard Disclaimer:]
These practice tests are intended to show bugs, but also to reveal places
where you may not be following all the automatic grader's nitpicking
requirements.  If you receive failure warnings on the preliminary tests
and then also have difficulty during the graded event, you have very little
recourse.  To take full advantage of the feedback provided in this course,
you must do the assignments in a timely fashion.

Test 4... is getword.c documented?
(Your getword.c documentation does NOT have to repeat the specs in getword.h,
but it should contain your name, instructor name [NOTE: 'Carroll' contains two
'R's and two 'L's], class (that is, 'CS570'), due date, etc.)
Your comments should help explain what the various parts of your code are doing.
Normally, your comments would be reviewed by a human.  But for this simple
assignment, the autograder merely checks for the class and instructor name.
One point was possible here; your total is now 3/3

Test 5... Does the gradernotes file exist?
Yes.
Your gradernotes file contains:
1:"I wrote this code myself but I used example inout2.c from C
2:by Discovery by Foster. I also read the first couple of 
3:chapters of this book to learn the C language. As errors 
4:occured I often googled syntax and used websites like
5:stackoverflow.com and various other that lead me to 
6:fix my code."
7:
8:As of right now my code is not finished and 
9:does not produce the correct output. 

The autograder is not good at parsing English (no surprise there), so it
will magnanimously award credit for the mere existence of the file -- but note
that there are _two_ MANDATORY statements you MUST include in this file.
Are you SURE you did that?

One more point was possible here; your total is now 4/4

Test 6: Checking all the soft links (calendar, p0 files):
Is the calendar soft link in place?
lrwxrwxrwx 1 cssc0018 carroll 31 Aug 30 10:16 /home/cs/carroll/cssc0018/calendar -> /home/cs/faculty/cs570/calendar
Yes.
Is the getword.h soft link in place?
ls -l ~cssc0018/Zero/getword.h
lrwxrwxrwx 1 cssc0018 carroll 37 Aug 30 12:58 /home/cs/carroll/cssc0018/Zero/getword.h -> /home/cs/faculty/cs570/Zero/getword.h
Yes.
Is the makefile soft link in place?
ls -l ~cssc0018/Zero/makefile
lrwxrwxrwx 1 cssc0018 carroll 36 Aug 30 12:42 /home/cs/carroll/cssc0018/Zero/makefile -> /home/cs/faculty/cs570/Zero/makefile
Yes.
Is the p0.c soft link in place?
ls -l ~cssc0018/Zero/p0.c
lrwxrwxrwx 1 cssc0018 carroll 32 Aug 30 12:50 /home/cs/carroll/cssc0018/Zero/p0.c -> /home/cs/faculty/cs570/Zero/p0.c
Yes.
Unless ALL these are right, you could LOSE a point here; your total is now 4/4

Likewise, your code should compile cleanly, without any serious warning messages
from the compiler:
Test 7... does your program compile?
make clean; make
rm -f *.o p0
gcc -g   -c -o getword.o getword.c
gcc -g   -c -o p0.o p0.c
gcc -o p0 getword.o p0.o
[1] 32313

Test 8... does your program handle the simplest situtations?
Here is the result of ~cssc0018/Zero/p0 < ~cs570/Data0/input1 :

Your output was:
n=10, s=[no-brainer]
n=3, s=[one]
n=0, s=[]
n=0, s=[]
n=-255, s=[]

A diff of the correct output with your output shows:
                              No differences encountered -- CONGRATULATIONS

To make any differences easy to see, the actual diff command I used was:
diff -a myoutput youroutput | cat -vt

One more point was possible here; your total is now 5/5

Test 9... does your program handle leading spaces and no trailing spaces?
Here is the result of ~cssc0018/Zero/p0 < ~cs570/Data0/input2 :

Your output was:
n=8, s=[trickier]
n=0, s=[]
n=3, s=[t$o]
n=-6, s=[master]
n=0, s=[]
n=-255, s=[]

A diff of the correct output with your output shows:
                              No differences encountered -- CONGRATULATIONS

One more point was possible here; your total is now 6/6

Test 10... how does your program react to a premature EOF?
Here is the result of ~cssc0018/Zero/p0 < ~cs570/Data0/input3 :

Your output was:
n=-10, s=[$different]
n=-5, s=[words]
n=-255, s=[]

A diff of the correct output with your output shows:
                              No differences encountered -- CONGRATULATIONS

One more point was possible here; your total is now 7/7

Test 11... does your program handle weird cases? (NOTE: negative 0 is still 0)
Here is the result of ~cssc0018/Zero/p0 < ~cs570/Data0/input4 :

Your output was:
n=0, s=[]
n=0, s=[]
n=0, s=[]
n=0, s=[]
n=-6, s=[expect]
n=22, s=[0,0,0,0,-6,22,0,0,-255]
n=0, s=[]
n=0, s=[]
n=-255, s=[]

A diff of the correct output with your output shows:
                              No differences encountered -- CONGRATULATIONS

One more point was possible here; your total is now 8/8

Your grade for this assignment may be adjusted by a (human) grader at the
due date.  Your grade could be as much as three points lower, depending on what
you have put in gradernotes, the presense of 'serious' compiler warnings, and
the quality of your getword.c documentation.
NOTE: Even if you get subsequent downgrades for things like documentation, that
does NOT put you at risk of disenrollment.  If this autograder score is
8/8, you will NOT be dropped.
Success on this assignment determines your competency in C, and whether or
not you will be disenrolled from CS570 for lack of prerequisites.  You
must have a PERFECT (autograder) score on this assignment to remain enrolled.
