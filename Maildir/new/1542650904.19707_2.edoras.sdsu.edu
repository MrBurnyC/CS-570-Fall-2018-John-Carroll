Below are the grade totals for the first four programming assignments
(p0, p1, p2 and p3).  The grade total for the midterm exam is in the far
right column, labelled "E1".  Recall that the midterm score is NOT combined
with the totals for the assignments, and is NOT reflected in the percent
(%) column, since a point on the midterm is not quite worth the same
as a point on an assignment.  The % column is just the average of your
program scores, which now incorporates p3.

At the end of the course, scores will be adjusted to reflect the 30%/25%/45%
split advertised in the syllabus for the assignments/midterm/final weights.
The final is already worth 45% of your grade, but if you do SIGNIFICANTLY
better on the final than on the midterm, I'll weight the final even more
heavily, to help boost your grade.  Start studying NOW, and remember that
you need to concentrate on understanding, not just memorization.

The lines below show the class average, maximum achieved, maximum possible,
and your score.
