Fairly soon, I'll be running the autograder for Program 1.  If you have
a compilable program in ~/One (perhaps just copy over your getword.c
from ~/Zero for now if you haven't started on the new requirements yet --
that way, at least you'll get feedback about what the tests are, and what
the right answers are supposed to be.

I've updated ~cs570/calendar (you will find this info in ~/calendar,
since you've created a convenient link already). For convenience,
I've included the new due dates in this mailing:

CS570 Program1  Monday, September 17  (the standard 11pm deadline)
CS570 Program2  Friday, October 6     (11pm 110% deadline)
CS570 Program2  Wednesday, October 11 (11pm 100% deadline)

The program1 deadline is quite soon, to maximize the time you have to
complete the BIG project (program2).  The program2 deadline is more
than a month away (though you can get EXTRA CREDIT if you turn it in 5
days earlier).

program3 won't be due until November, to leave time to study for our
midterm.  You folks will vote on a midterm date when we get closer to
the proper time -- I want to be a little ways into Chapter 3 when we
have the exam.  But you can expect it to be in the latter half of October.

Stay tuned for some autograder results!

Cheers,
jc
