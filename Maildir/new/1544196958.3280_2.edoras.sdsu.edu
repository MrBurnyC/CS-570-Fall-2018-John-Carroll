We did not cover all the lecture material in the xeroxed notes; you are
only responsible for what was presented in class (we stopped on Page 64).
That means none of the Chapter 8 material will be on the final (so
ignore the Chapter 8 exercises).  We didn't get to the lecture notes I
have under the heading "Chapter 10" (Pages 68-72), but recall that we
have been bouncing into Chapter 10 material all semester long -- so some
of the Chapter 10 Exercises (Page 87) will still be appropriate for the
final (see below).  As with the midterm, the Exercises in my notes are
your best clue as to what previous final questions looked like.

This writeup can be found on edoras under ~cs570/final_advice .

Here is the official coverage for the CS570 final exam for Fall 2018:

We've covered most of Chapter 10 (Linux) when it became relevant in the ot=
her
Chapters, and my notes also covered some details that are not in Tanenbaum=
.
Much of my Chapter 10 lecture notes are devoted to how the preprocessor,
compiler, and linker work, along with associated things like libraries, an=
d
we unfortunately didn't get to that.  As with the midterm, topics/sections
not mentioned in my notes are not candidates for questions on the final.

After finals are over, you might consider reading the rest of the lecture
notes.  And you might well find Sections 9.5 onward in Tanenbaum to be
entertaining, and it might even inspire you to consider our Computer
Security class as an elective.  Wait until the semester is over, of course=
,
before you look at that.

Approximately 1/3 of the final will draw from pre-midterm material,
so the advice on edoras in ~cs570/midterm_advice is still relevant.
You will likely be asked to deal with code that needs critical regions,
semaphores, etc., and have to do some calculations to compute things like
page frame size, address sizes, virtual to physical address translation, e=
tc.

Most of the relevant material is in the xeroxed notes, which matches Tanen=
baum's
exposition EXCEPT for flash memory, the GPT and UEFI lecture material, and=
 the
explanation about how rohan used the log-structured filesystem to create
efficient hourly backups (in my Chapter 4 notes).  These 'EXCEPTional' top=
ics
are in my notes, but not in Tanenbaum -- so study my notes carefully.

NOTE: Our final is on Thursday, 12/13/18, from 10:30am to 12:30pm.  I'll t=
ry
to arrive about 5 minutes early, so that we can have a bit of extra time.
The exam will therefore run from approximately 10:25 to 12:35.  Once I
call for the exams to be handed in, I expect everyone to stop writing.
It's not fair for some people to continue working on the exam once others
have stopped, so this WILL be enforced.

The page and exercise numbers below are for the THIRD EDITION of Tanenbaum=
.

The exam will be closed-book, but you may bring to the exam TWO 8.5x11-inc=
h
pages of notes (you can write/xerox/doodle on both sides of the page).  Ev=
en
though there should be enough room to write all your answers on the exam,
you might want notebook paper for your answers anyway.  I'll have a staple=
r
with me, to attach your answers to the exam. (I'll also bring some paper,
in case anyone runs out.)

The xeroxed Chapter notes form a fairly accurate guide to the material we
have covered.  Approximately 2/3 of the final will be 'new' material that
was not covered on the midterm.  Problematic topics from the midterm are
the most likely ones to be revisited on the final.  Here is a summary of
the relevant pages in Tanenbaum that correspond to our lectures:
Chapter 1: Pages 1-59
Chapter 2: Pages 83-158, 169-170
Chapter 6: Page 462
Chapter 3: Pages 175-216, plus some highlights from the remaining sections
Chapter 4: Pages 255-268, 273-286, 311-317
Chapter 5: Pages 329-343, 360-363,  367-373, 376-379, 382-384, 388-392 * t=
his
semester we did not finish all of chapter 5, so coverage stops at Page 392=
)
Chapter 10: portions of Pages 731-802 -- as referred to in the lecture not=
es
for Chapters 1-5.

Most of what is in my lecture notes is also covered in the above list of
Tanenbaum pages (with the exceptions noted above).

Tanenbaum's end-of-chapter questions form an effective review of the mater=
ial;
Here is a summary of the problems I recommended from the various chapters:
Chapter 1 (Page  79): 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 14, 17, 18, 19, 22
Chapter 2 (Page 170): 1, 3, 10, 11, 23, 45, 46, 47
Chapter 6 (Page 465): 30
Chapter 3 (Page 249): 4, 12, 13, 15, 18, 19, 20, 32
Chapter 4 (Page 325): 1, 4, 15, 17, 21, 33, 34
Chapter 5 (Page 429): 13, 22 (consider seek time, latency, transfer rate) =
* (we
did not get far enough to have problem #30 be relevant in Fall 2018, so sk=
ip it)
Chapter 10 (Page 808): 4, 9, 14, 17, 20, 24-25, 27, 31, 33, 37
If you have the fourth edition of Tanenbaum, ignore the above numbers; the
page numbers and problem numbers are listed at the bottom of my Exercises.=
]

We actually talked a LOT about IDE controllers and drives, but there aren'=
t
many good sample questions in the Problem lists.  (We didn't talk about
all of the devices in this chapter, and you're not responsible for any
of the 'ignored' devices, of course.  We covered IDE devices, CDROMS, cloc=
ks;
Normally, we'd also consider keyboards, mice, and a bit about terminals
and GUIs, but we ran out of time in Fall 2018.)

There were also some non-Tanenbaum topics in the lecture notes: flash memo=
ry,
the newer GPT, and the UEFI replacement for the old BIOS, for example.  My
Exercise sheets list some sample questions regarding these topics.  These =
are
toward the back of the xeroxed notes; there are additional exercises relat=
ed
to the chapters we have covered (Xeroxed Pages 78-88).  Most of these are =
also
good examples of exam questions [in fact, they have occurred on previous e=
xams],
and many have answers.  Don't neglect them!

What you CAN neglect are my exercises that cover topics we didn't get to t=
his
semester.  In Fall 2018, all the questions listed for Chapter 1, 2, 3, and=
 4
are fair game (Pages 78-85).  Of my Chapter 5 questions (Page 86), 1, 2, 4=
,
5, 10, 11, 12, and 13 are relevant.  Of my Chapter 10 questions (Page 87),
2, 3, 4, and 7 are relevant.  Ignore Page 88.

Cheers,
jc
