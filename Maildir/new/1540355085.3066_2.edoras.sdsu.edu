A few people have asked for clarification about how much of a
'cheat sheet' you are allowed to bring to the CS570 midterm on
Thursday.  It's making me wonder if I at some point mis-spoke in
class one day.  Officially, you may bring exactly what it says in
the ~cs570/midterm_advice file (which has the same content as
the mailing I broadcast about the exam):


The exam will be closed-book, but you may bring to the exam ONE
8.5x11-inch page of notes (you can write/xerox/doodle on both sides
of the page).


So, that's the 'official' word.

Cheers,
jc
