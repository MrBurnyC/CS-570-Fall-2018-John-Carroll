Folks,
Remember that you MUST use vertical piping in program4, or you'll lose
ALL the points from ALL the piping inputs (so that's likely at least 25
points out the window).  So definitely do NOT go for the extra credit
deadline if you don't get this resolved!

The last test (input16) helps you determine if you're vertical or horizontal;
you need to see all different numbers under the PPID column when you run
the test.  (And the autograder tells you how to run each of these tests
'by hand' any time you wish.)

I've added a few more 'check items' to the checklist at the bottom of
your mailing (and I may add more tomorrow) -- so remember to look over all
the stuff I'll be checking for.

Cheers,
jc
