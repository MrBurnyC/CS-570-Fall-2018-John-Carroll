CS570 folks:  The file ~cs570/8-30-18script is a transcript of what
I typed at the keyboard in class today (along with the computer's
responses).  I've edited it with explanations of the salient points of
most of the steps, in case there were some nuances you missed during class=
.

IMPORTANT:
Remember that, as per the README file in your home directory, you are
supposed to change your shell to tcsh (this condition was left off the
pink handout by mistake, but the autograder will definitely be checking
that you did this).

Cheers,
jc

ps -- for your convenience, I've also appended the contents of the script
to this email; but a permanent copy will always be at ~cs570/8-30-18script=
 .




Below is a script of the session demonstrated in class on Thursday.
But first, here are some comments about the points that were made today --
the explanations below are keyed to the history numbers (the numbers in
square brackets in the prompts) for the relevant commands that were typed.
A good way to review this is to ssh to edoras a second time, then look
at these comments in one window, and look at the script [further down
in this file] in the second window as you read along.

[29] Recall that '~cs570' meant "the home directory of the cs570 username"
[30] !! would repeat the last command; !$ repeats the last word of the
last command.  So !$/* became ~cs570/Data0/*
If you want to know more about the 'more' command, type:
man more
...to see the man page.  Similarly, to find out about the ungetc() functio=
n
that you'll need in Program0/Program1/Program2/Program4, you'd do:
man ungetc
[31] Since input3 did not contain a newline, the next prompt (#30) came
right after the word 'words'
[32] The '^3^2^' pattern repeated the previous command, but with '2'
substituted for the original '3'
[33] wc is short for 'word count'; it shows the number of lines, words,
and characters in the three files mentioned
[34-35] mkdir creates a new directory 'Zero', which was not there before.
[36] note the !$ trick again...
[37] pwd is 'print working directory', where we verify the result of
the cd command on line #36
[38-40] The empty directory becomes populated after the 'ln' command
[43] The '@' appended onto the file names indicates they are soft links
[44] We used the inout2.c code as a basis for getword.c
[46] 'make' immediately failed, since we did not yet have getword.h, which
p0.c required to be #include'd
[49] The compilation of getword.c and p0.c (the two -c lines) proceeded
without complaint, but the linking step (of the two .o files) complained,
for several reasons:  There was no getword() function (in the files nor
in any library the linker could find), and we had two versions of main().
[50] The .o files were created, but the linker could not assemble the p0 b=
inary
[52] After making more corrections, compilation [and now linking] was succ=
essful
[53] We can run the 'original' ls (via /bin/ls) if we don't want to see
the @, /, and * appended to filenames
[54] Our 'broken' getword() now just parrots back what was input.  We simu=
late
an EOF by typing control-D at the keyboard -- that didn't help here, since
our code was never returning -255, so main() never halts.  So at the momen=
t
I needed control-C to kill the program.
[55] make was smart enough (by checking the file timestamps) to know that
the current p0 binary did not need to be recompiled -- because p0 had a mo=
re
recent modification date than the source files,
[56] Rather than typing from the keyboard, we can use input redirection
(via '<') to make p0 read from a file (input3 in this case).  This again
caused a huge infinite loop until I killed the program with control-C.
[58-60] Someone asked about the .forward file, so we created one 'on the f=
ly'.
The '-a' option to ls shows all the files, including the hidden ones (the
ones starting with '.')

Remember that, as per the README file in your home directory, you are supp=
osed
to change your shell to tcsh (this condition was left off the pink handout
by mistake, but the autograder will definitely be checking that you did th=
is).
