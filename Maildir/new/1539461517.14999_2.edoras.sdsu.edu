Our midterm will cover the four chapters (1, 2, 6, 3) listed below,
including [most] of Chapter 3.  Later, I will be able to confirm just how
much of Chapter 3 we will cover; so there will be an additional mailing
where  I'll announce more accurate coverage.  Basically, coverage will
stop wherever the in-class lecture stops on October 18; October 23
will be reserved for review and exercise-solving.

The midterm for CS570 is scheduled for Thursday, October 25, 2018.
The exam will be closed-book, but you may bring to the exam ONE
8.5x11-inch page of notes (you can write/xerox/doodle on both sides
of the page).  Occasionally students pool resources and create a
compact, whiz-bang compendium of facts, which multiple people can
then print and use.  While this is legal [ANYTHING you want to put
on either side is legal], I don't recommend it; sifting through the
material to create the notes, deciding what is important, and then
writing it down is the most useful thing you can do to study for
the exam -- this process is where you're actually going to learn
the material.  Using a canned sheet will be better than walking
into the exam empty-handed, but even a seriously incomplete sheet
that you've constructed yourself will almost certainly lead to a
better outcome than using someone else's list.

There ought to be enough room to write all your answers on the
printed exam, but I'll bring some additional paper to class in case
anyone runs out of space.  I'll have a stapler with me, to attach
additional sheets to the exam.  (If you prefer to use your own paper,
make sure it is 8.5x11 inches, and NOT ripped out of a spiral-bound
notebook -- definitely use my paper if spiral is all you have.)

The exam will cover Chapters 1,2,6,3; specifics are given below,
such as the sections/topics we have skipped.  There are bits of
Chapter 10 you will find useful, too.

The in-class Chapter xeroxed notes form a fairly accurate guide
to the material we have covered, although the written notes for
Chapter 1 end around Page 20, whereas we in fact discussed this
overview material in class in some detail up through Page 59; the
remainder of the chapter was only covered briefly, so Page 60 and
beyond will therefore be de-emphasized on the exam[s].

The end-of-chapter questions (beginning on Page 79 for Chapter 1)
form an effective review of the material; a few of the exam
questions may be of the short-answer variety, such as:
1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 14, 17, 18, 19, 22.
(This list of 'Tanenbaum questions' is reiterated near the top
of the Exercises1 file of the lecture notes.)  One would hope you
now have a pretty good handle on #30 on Page 82...  (For those of
you with the 4th edition: at the bottom of my published Exercise sheets
you will find a list the corresponding page numbers and problem numbers
for the fourth edition.)

In Chapter 2, we covered topics through page 146; it's not a bad
idea to review the summary on Pages 169-170.  Note that near the
end of my Chapter 2 notes, scheduling in UNIX is discussed in more
detail than you will find in Tanenbaum.

Some end-of-chapter questions (beginning on Page 170 for Chapter 2):
1, 3, 10, 11, 23, 45, 46, 47 Tanenbaum, Chapter 10 (Page 808): 9, 14
Recall that the Summary (Page 462) gives a good synopsis of the
important concepts in Chapter 6.  Problem 30 (Page 465) is related
to ideas in Chapter 2, and is an appropriate exercise.

Here are some relevant exercises for the material related to
Chapter 3 (these start on Page 248): 4, 12, 13, 15, 18, 19, 20,
26, 32 Chapter 10 (Page 809): 20, 24
This list is likely to SHRINK somewhat, depending on how far
we venture into Chapter 3 this week, so put your study emphasis
on the other three chapters for now, until you get a more accurate
list of which Chapter 3 problems will be relevant for the midterm.

In Chapter 10, we have looked at various sections as we have
needed them.  Useful parts to review prior to the midterm are:
Section 10.2.1, 10.2.3, 10.2.4, 10.3.1, 10.3.2, 10.3.3, 10.4.1,
10.6.1 (Pages 729,732-736,739-749,758-761,780-781).

It is highly likely that I will give you some (flawed) code for
cooperating processes (a la dining philosophers) and ask you
for a failure scenario.  You should be able to give a precise
sequence of steps of two (or more) processes that leads to deadlock
or starvation.  I might also ask for some insight as to how to
correct the problem.  [You need not write down or memorize the
scenarios on your cheat sheet; I'll include the code on the exam,
and if it is different than the code in Tanenbaum, I will (usually)
point out where the differences are.]

It is highly likely that I will ask about some issue relevant to
programming a shell.  (If you successfully completed the shell
programming assignment, such questions should be trivial to answer.)

It is highly likely that I will ask about some arithmetic issue
relevant to virtual memory (translating some address, calculating
the number of page frames or pages, determining the number of
bits necessary to specify an offset for a given page size, etc.)
Experience has shown that many students have trouble making these
calculations; since similar questions will recur on the final,
NOW is the time to study this thoroughly!

Here are some good questions from the Second Edition of Tanenbaum
that are not present in later editions:

A) A computer system has enough room to hold four programs in its
main memory.  These programs are idle waiting for I/O half the time.
What fraction of the CPU time is wasted?  What is the utilization
of the CPU?

B) Using the page table in Figure 3-9 (Page 190), give the physical
address corresponding to each of the following virtual addresses:
i)   20 ii)  4100 iii) 8300

Toward the back of the xeroxed notes, there are additional exercises
related to the chapters we have covered (starting on page 76;
many of them have answers supplied).  Most of these are also good
examples of exam questions.  (Indeed, most of these are taken from
previous exams that I have given.)

The class session prior to the exam will be set aside for review.
We can consider some of these sample exam problems, and also go
over any concepts that still seem confusing.

Cheers,
jc
