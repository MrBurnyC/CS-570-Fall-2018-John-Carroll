Below you'll find the grades for all 5 programs, along with your total
program points, and the corresponding percentage.  The class average for the
programming aspect is 83%.  (If you're over 100% in the '%' column, remember
that those extra points will work toward enhancing your exam scores.)

You can work out what score you need for the final by applying the formula
that I will be putting in my spreadsheet:

0.45 X (grade_on_final) + 2 X 0.25 X (number under the 'E1' column) + 
0.30 X (number under the '%' column)  =  your course percentage

So you can put in various numbers into the grade_on_final slot and see how
the percentages will shake out.  Keep in mind that a substantial improvement
on the final will give your letter grade a bigger boost than the above
formula might indicate.

The lines below show the class average, maximum achieved, maximum possible,
and your score.
