This is the extra credit test of your upcoming Program 3.  Remember,
regular credit submissions can be turned in later. (next week)

If your GradeEarly file is in place now, you will see the results of
an extensive test of your code.  Otherwise, you'll only see an announcement
that GradeEarly does not exist, and that testing is bypassed (this time).

[Standard Disclaimer:]
These practice tests are intended to show bugs, but also to reveal places
where you may not be following all the automatic grader's nitpicking
requirements.  If you receive failure warnings on the preliminary tests
and then also have difficulty during the graded event, you have very little
recourse.  To take full advantage of the feedback provided in this course,
you must do the assignments in a timely fashion.

Checking Program 3:
Remember, the GradeEarly file will be used to decide if you are FINISHED.
If the GradeEarly file is present at the extra-credit deadline,
your program will be considered 'submitted', with NO further chance for
modifications.  Checking if the GradeEarly file exists:
ls -l ~cssc0018/Three/GradeEarly
-rw------- 1 cssc0018 carroll 12 Nov  1 10:42 /home/cs/carroll/cssc0018/Three/GradeEarly
The GradeEarly file exists, so the following WILL be graded now.
Good.

NOTE: Make sure your p3helper.c documentation EXPLAINS your solution strategy.
Remember that you are to try to provide maximum concurrency (lots of people in,
the gym), in addition to avoiding 'breaking the rules'-- so describe how that
is achieved.

Maximum of =0= instances of protocol failure for cssc0018!
Maximum simultaneous jogger occupancy was @7@ for cssc0018
Maximum simultaneous shooter occupancy was @3@ for cssc0018

End of tests.
Check carefully that you allowed more than one shooter at a time,
more than one jogger at a time, and that there were ZERO protocol failures.

The /bin/time command can report things like the amount of [wall clock] time.
In this run of p3, it was: elapsed_time=1:06.00

Your grade for this assignment will be determined by a (human) grader
at the due date.
The automation did not attempt to assign any points.
All 20 points will be assigned by a human.
