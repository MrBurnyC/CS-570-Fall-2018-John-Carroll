This is a **preliminary** test of your upcoming Program 4.

This message, which will appear to be mailed from your account, is intended to
show you some (but not necessarily all) of the checks that will be made on your
assignment when the due date actually arrives.  This is NOT the actual version
that will be graded, but only an attempt to give you early warning of any
potential problems.  Point totals in the final graded version may differ.

[Standard Disclaimer:]
These practice tests are intended to show bugs, but also to reveal places
where you may not be following all the automatic grader's nitpicking
requirements.  If you receive failure warnings on the preliminary tests
and then also have difficulty during the graded event, you have very little
recourse.  To take full advantage of the feedback provided in this course,
you must do the assignments in a timely fashion.

Checking Program 4: 16/42
Remember, the GradeEarly file will be used to decide if you are FINISHED.
If the GradeEarly file is present at the extra-credit deadline,
your program will be considered 'submitted', with NO further chance for
modifications.  Checking if the GradeEarly file exists:
ls -l ~cssc0018/Two/GradeEarly
-rw------- 1 cssc0018 carroll 11 Oct  5 12:37 /home/cs/carroll/cssc0018/Two/GradeEarly
If this were the extra credit deadline (11pm Wednesday, 11/28/18),
the autograder WOULD collect your program.

----------------------------------------------------------------------system
Calls to system() are NOT being used, right?:
grep -n system p2.c
12: * 			- To handle execution we use system calls like dup2, execvp, fork, and pipe, etc.

Test 4... is p2.c documented?
(Your p2.c documentation does NOT have to repeat all the specs for p2,
but it should list your name, instructor name [NOTE: 'Carroll' contains
two 'R's and two 'L's], class [that is, 'CS570'], due date, etc.)
A brief synopsis and guidance at decision points / tricky issues will suffice.
You may LOSE a point here if keywords are missing; your total is now 0/0
(Many more points depend on your documentation, but a human will have to
assign the remaining documentation points.)

Test 5... how is the syntax?

for example, splint may complain if you don't save the value that printf()
returns (even if this may be a perfectly reasonable thing to ignore).

Test 6... Does the gradernotes file exist?
Yes.
Your gradernotes file contains:

1:"I wrote this code myself but I used the p2.c outline 
2: in the lecture notes to jump start my p2.c 
3: As errors occured I often googled syntax and used websites like
4: stackoverflow.com and various other that lead me to 
5: fix my code." I also emailed Dr. Caroll for help and hints on this program and 
6: he has given me very good help that has lead me to finish it. 
7:
8:Notes:
9:-The documentation of p2.h explains the methods and their input and output values. Throughout the p2.c code there is various comments explaining how things work which serve more as a reminder and aid for myself.
10:-My program has a total of 
11:
12:Decisions:
13:Started off using global big buffer and new argv arrays but my code was broken and I got frustrated and stared alover using parameters for these values and it was more complicated as we now have parameters that need to point to the global variables. I wanted to make major components of the program modular so I would be able to pinpoint the error if it happened. It was more overhead but I think it was worth it.
14:For the order of my code I have parse and main as the primarily methods but there are helper methods.   
15:
16:Errors that are ambiguous commands are flagged with errors sent to stderr with perror.
17:
18:
19:
20:As of right now my code is finished, has no known bugs and 
21:does produce the correct output which has been verified
22:by the autograder. It doesn't not include the last 3 points for the correct implementation of vertical piping or the points for the quality of the documentation. .

You may LOSE another point here if it doesn't exist; your total is now 0/0
(Note that TWO required statements belong in this file; also list your design
decisions here [see the 'checklist' below for samples of what to include .]
A human grader will check this later, and perhaps adjust your score.)

Test 7... are the makefile and getword.h soft links in place?
ls -l ~cssc0018/Two/makefile ~cssc0018/Two/getword.h
lrwxrwxrwx 1 cssc0018 carroll 36 Oct  2 10:23 /home/cs/carroll/cssc0018/Two/getword.h -> /home/cs/faculty/cs570/One/getword.h

makefile is correctly linked.
getword.h is correctly linked.
If you don't have the right setup, you could LOSE a point here;
                                       Your total is now 0/0

Test 8... are the proper .h files included in your source code?
One more point was possible here; your total is now 1/1
(If you are failing this test, just #include all the .h files for the system
calls recommended for program2, even if you are not yet using all those calls.)
There are (at least) 8 header files that you will need.
And of course, if you're using non-recommended calls, make sure you have the
proper .h files for those, too.

Test 9... does your program compile?

Test 10... does your program handle escaped metacharacters?
Here is the result of ~cssc0018/Two/p2 < ~cs570/Data4/input2 :

Your output was:
:570: >>rat ear|
:570: cacxxxfac|
:570: p2 terminated.

The correct output is (note how some spaces turn into x's):
:570: >>rat ear|
:570: cacxxxfac|

Test 11... does 'cd' with no arguments work, and CHANGE the prompt?
Here is the result of ~cssc0018/Two/p2 < ~cs570/Data4/input3 :
(I randomly set the HOME variable, so don't expect ~cssc0018 in the output.)

Your output was:

The correct output is:
/usr/local/bin

Here is the result of ~cssc0018/Two/p2 < ~cs570/Data4/input53 :

The contents of stdout/stderr was:
:570: :570: :570:  		Lots	of: command not found.
:570: :570:  mydelimiter: command not found.
:570: :570:  mydelimiter: command not found.
:570: p2 terminated.

'tr' should have caused the following to be printed:
		LOts	Of  whItEspAcE     bEtwEEn wOrds.

Test 23... does 'hereis' work in a pipeline with redirection?
Here is the result of ~cssc0018/Two/p2 < ~cs570/Data4/input55 :

The contents of stdout/stderr was:
:570: :570: :570: :570:  line1: command not found.
:570: :570:  underline: command not found.
:570: :570:  sentence2: command not found.
:570: :570:  line3: command not found.
:570: :570:  hereisEOF: command not found.
:570: p2 terminated.

Only the valid prompts should appear on stdin (and nothing on stderr).
                                              ERROR    ERROR    ERROR    ERROR
The results of the pipeline (in your.output55) was:

The proper file contents should be:

Test 24... does your program handle badly-constructed commands?
NOTE: This test starts in /etc/X11, so the 'cd ..' should leave you in /etc/ .
Here is the result of ~cssc0018/Two/p2 < ~cs570/Data4/input10 :

What was sent to stdout was:
:570: :570: NotADefinedVariable
:570: :570: :570: :570: :570: :570: :570: 
Your shell did not seem to process subsequent valid commands (echo, cd, pwd).
                                              ERROR    ERROR    ERROR    ERROR
Your shell failed to change the prompt to 'etc:570: ' after the cd.

:570:  cannot redirect input because no executable has been provided.
:570:  syntax error expected file name after input redirection.
:570:  no process provided after `|'.

If your stderr message complained about confusing options, then CONGRATULATIONS
may be appropriate.

Of course, a human will have to judge the quality of your error/warning messages

Three more points were possible here; your total is now 16/42

The assignment will be worth 44 points (after a human grades it).

Test 25... no points, just a way of checking if vertical piping is implemented.
Examine the output of the ps command below carefully.  If you are doing vertical
piping correctly, EACH 'sleep' process will have a different parent (shown in
the PPID column).  If so, relax -- you're doing things right.

But if several children report the SAME parent, this is horizontal piping.
The autograder is too dumb to check this effectively, so it may be reporting a
MUCH higher score than is warranted.

If you fail to do vertical piping, it [negatively] affects your grade.  A human
(me) will have to sadly demolish your piping points when I grade the printouts.

NOTE: ~cs570/vertical does "ps -lyfww", then filters out confusing lines
(And I got rid of some prompts, so things line up better.)

Your grade for this assignment will be determined by a (human) grader
at the due date.
MORE TESTS WILL BE ADDED TO THE AUTOGRADER LATER.
The automation currently only tests 42 out of the total 44 points;
a human will determine whether you have earned the remaining 2 points,
and if you miss too much stuff on the checklist below, you'll LOSE some of
the 16 points already awarded.
(On the automated part, you scored 16/42.)
See the extensive checklist to get an idea of what I will be looking for.

your project WOULD have been collected and graded with extra credit.
Program 4 gradesheet

a PARTIAL checklist of things the grader may judge:

Quality of documentation & header info          constants, etc. documented?
                                        ___/    name, class, date?
Program logic and correctness                   mnemonics, no 'magic constants'?
                                        ___/
Appropriate bad-syntax error messages           e.g., does a tilde failure
                                        ___/    announce what the issue was?
NO inappropriate duplicate output lines
(neither stderr nor stdout)             ___/    Research fflush()
Correct foreground child wait()ed for?
                                        ___/    2 statements, and also:
MULTIPLE required items in gradernotes?         E.g., what do you do if you see:
                                        ___/    echo hi> | ?   Document your
Documentation of individual choices             choices *in gradernotes*, so
                                        ___/    that I can find it!
Background processes dup2 on /dev/null?
                                        ___/
Background processes terminate correctly        Are background zombies reaped?
                                        ___/
Does p2 announce environ lookup errors?
                                        ___/
Do you exit upon execvp failure?                Same for pipe, dup2, open, etc.?
                                        ___/
Does a child create grandchild in pipes?        IMPORTANT!!! You will LOSE *ALL*
                                        ___/    the pipeline points if you did
Is your character array long enough?            not use 'vertical' pipelining.
                                        ___/
"p2 terminated" printf comes AFTER killpg       (This is how I check if your
                                        ___/    signal handler is working...)
Unexpected behavior (if any) documented
in gradernotes file                     ___/    SAY what isn't working!
                                       ______
                                      |      |
                                      |______|
                                      |  44  |
                                      |______|
