This is a **preliminary** test of your upcoming Program 2.

This message, which will appear to be mailed from your account, is intended to
show you some (but not necessarily all) of the checks that will be made on your
assignment when the due date actually arrives.  This is NOT the actual version
that will be graded, but only an attempt to give you early warning of any
potential problems.  Point totals in the final graded version may differ.

[Standard Disclaimer:]
These practice tests are intended to show bugs, but also to reveal places
where you may not be following all the automatic grader's nitpicking
requirements.  If you receive failure warnings on the preliminary tests
and then also have difficulty during the graded event, you have very little
recourse.  To take full advantage of the feedback provided in this course,
you must do the assignments in a timely fashion.

Checking Program 2:

Remember, the GradeEarly file will be used to decide if you are FINISHED.
If the GradeEarly file is present at the extra-credit deadline,
your program will be considered 'submitted', with NO further chance for
modifications.  Checking if the GradeEarly file exists:
ls -l ~cssc0018/Two/GradeEarly
/bin/ls: cannot access /home/cs/carroll/cssc0018/Two/GradeEarly: No such file or directory
This indicates you are NOT currently applying for extra credit.
Your solution would then be collected (for normal credit) the following week.

Test 3... Checking for some prescribed/proscribed features;
a human will have to look over the output from the grep commands...
----------------------------------------------------------------------STORAGE
Are you defining a character buffer large enough to handle MANY 'long' words?
egrep -n '#define|STORAGE' p2.h p2.c

p2.h:33:#define MAXSIZE (STORAGE*MAXITEM) /*Max amount of characetr per commandline */
----------------------------------------------------------------------SIG
Are children being terminated with the correct signal?
egrep -n 'SIG|setp|signal|terminated' p2.c
19:	setpgid(0,0); // Sets current process and children to its own process group
20:	(void) signal(SIGTERM,sighandler); // Signal handler to catch SIGTERM
83:	killpg(getpgrp(),SIGTERM);
84:	printf("p2 terminated.\n");
----------------------------------------------------------------------wait
Is the parent waiting for a child?  ...For the CORRECT child?
egrep -n 'wait|while' p2.c
21:	while(TRUE){
165:	} while (word_size != EOF && word_size != ZERO_COMMANDS); // read until a line terminator is encountered
179:	int wait_status;
193:		/* if background flag is not set then the shell waits
198:				wait_status = wait(NULL);

177:void exec_command(char *command, char **args){
213:void run_child_command(char *command, char **args){
297:void clear_flags(){
311:void sighandler(){
----------------------------------------------------------------------null
Are you ensuring that background children don't compete for keyboard input?
grep -n /dev/null p2.c
282:		file_descriptor = open("/dev/null", O_RDONLY);
----------------------------------------------------------------------fflush
Are you ensuring that children inherit only empty buffers?
egrep -n 'fork|fflush' p2.c
12: * 			- To handle execution we use system calls like dup2, execvp, fork, and pipe, etc.
30:			fflush(stdout);
35:			fflush(stdout);
37:			fflush(stderr);
180:	fflush(stdout);// Flushing before a fork to ensure stdout & stdout buffers are clear for the child.
181:	fflush(stderr);
183:	if((child_pid = fork()) == FAIL){
227:	fflush(stdout);
228:	fflush(stderr);
----------------------------------------------------------------------exit
Do all children exit() upon failure?
egrep -n 'execvp|exit|dup2|open|CHK|perror' p2.c
12: * 			- To handle execution we use system calls like dup2, execvp, fork, and pipe, etc.
18:	//int exit_code;
36:			perror("Parse error");
41:		 * use execvp to execute cd.
48:					perror("cd command failed to go HOME");	
58:					perror("Failed to cd into directory");		
65:				perror("cd has an invalid number of arguments");
116:					perror("Cannot have multiple pipes");		
120:					perror("Need to an argument to pipe to.");
184:		perror("Forked failed");
222:			perror("Redirection error");
223:			exit(-2);
231:	if(execvp(command, args) == FAIL){
233:		perror("Exec failed");
234:		exit(1);
243:		 * read and write permissions as indicated b the flags passed to open
246:			perror("File exists");	
249:		file_descriptor = open(outfile, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR);
252:			perror("Cannot open overwrite file");
253:			exit(-3);
256:		/* Redirecting output from stdout to the open file*/
258:		if(dup2(file_descriptor, STDOUT_FILENO) < SUCCESS){

284:			perror("Cannot open file with background flag ");
285:			exit(-7);
287:		if(dup2(file_descriptor, STDIN_FILENO) < SUCCESS){
288:			perror("input redirection failed with background flag");
289:			exit(-9);
NOTE: sometimes _exit() can be preferable to exit()
----------------------------------------------------------------------parse
What (if anything) are you passing to parse?
grep -n parse( p2.c
23:		new_argv_size = parse(new_argv, line);
95:int parse(char **commands , char *line){ 
----------------------------------------------------------------------system
Calls to system() are NOT being used, right?:
grep -n system p2.c
12: * 			- To handle execution we use system calls like dup2, execvp, fork, and pipe, etc.

Test 4... is p2.c documented?
(Your p2.c documentation does NOT have to repeat all the specs for p2,
but it should list your name, instructor name [NOTE: 'Carroll' contains
two 'R's and two 'L's], class [that is, 'CS570'], due date, etc.)
A brief synopsis and guidance at decision points / tricky issues will suffice.
You may LOSE a point here if keywords are missing; your total is now 0/0
(Many more points depend on your documentation, but a human will have to
assign the remaining documentation points.)

Test 5... how is the syntax?
make splint
splint -warnposix +trytorecover -weak getword.c p2.c
Splint 3.1.2 --- 11 Oct 2015

getword.c:298:17: Comment starts inside comment
  A comment open sequence (/*) appears within a comment.  This usually means an
  earlier comment was not closed. (Use -nestcomment to inhibit warning)
p2.c:156:24: Comment starts inside comment
p2.c:157:19: Comment starts inside comment
p2.c: (in function main)
p2.c:74:4: Unrecognized identifier: exec_command
  Identifier used in code has not been declared. (Use -unrecog to inhibit
  warning)
p2.c:83:2: Unrecognized identifier: killpg
p2.c: (in function run_child_command)
p2.c:221:27: Unrecognized identifier: set_up_redirection
p2.c:221:6: Test expression for if is assignment expression:
               redirection_return = set_up_redirection() < -14
  The condition test is an assignment expression. Probably, you mean to use ==
  instead of =. If an assignment is intended, add an extra parentheses nesting
  (e.g., if ((a = b)) ...) to suppress this message. (Use -predassign to
  inhibit warning)
p2.c:214:6: Variable wait_status declared but not used
  A variable is declared but never used. Use /*@unused@*/ in front of
  declaration to suppress message. (Use -varuse to inhibit warning)
p2.c:215:8: Variable child_pid declared but not used

Finished checking --- 9 code warnings
make: *** [splint] Error 1

NOTE: not everything that 'splint' comments about is necessarily a bad thing;
for example, splint may complain if you don't save the value that printf()
returns (even if this may be a perfectly reasonable thing to ignore).

Test 6... Does the gradernotes file exist?
Yes.
Your gradernotes file contains:

1:"I wrote this code myself but I used the p2.c outline 
2: in the lecture notes to jump start my p2.c 
3: As errors occured I often googled syntax and used websites like
4: stackoverflow.com and various other that lead me to 
5: fix my code." I also emailed Dr. Caroll for help and hints on this program and 
6: he has given me very good help that has lead me to finish it. 
7:
8:As of right now my code is finished, has no known bugs and 
9:does produce the correct output which has been verified
10:by the autograder.

You may LOSE a point here if it doesn't exist; your total is now 0/0
(Note that TWO required statements belong in this file; also list your design
decisions here [see the 'checklist' below for samples of what to include .]
A human grader will check this later, and perhaps adjust your score.)

Test 7... are the makefile and getword.h soft links in place?
ls -l ~cssc0018/Two/makefile ~cssc0018/Two/getword.h
lrwxrwxrwx 1 cssc0018 carroll 36 Oct  2 10:23 /home/cs/carroll/cssc0018/Two/getword.h -> /home/cs/faculty/cs570/One/getword.h
lrwxrwxrwx 1 cssc0018 carroll 35 Sep 18 08:58 /home/cs/carroll/cssc0018/Two/makefile -> /home/cs/faculty/cs570/Two/makefile
makefile is correctly linked.
getword.h is correctly linked.
If you don't have the right setup, you could LOSE a point here;
                                       Your total is now 0/0

Test 8... are the proper .h files included in your source code?
One more point was possible here; your total is now 1/1
(If you are failing this test, just #include all the .h files for the system
calls recommended for program2, even if you are not yet using all those calls.)
There are (at least) 8 header files that you will need.
And of course, if you're using non-recommended calls, make sure you have the
proper .h files for those, too.

NOTE: Review the earlier splint output; if some function names are tagged as
"Unrecognized identifier", this is a pretty big hint about what you are missing.

Test 9... does your program compile?
make clean; make

Test 10... does your program ignore '&' as a command separator if it is in
the middle of the line, and handle '\;' correctly?
Here is the result of ~cssc0018/Two/p2 < ~cs570/Data2/input1 :

Your output was:
:570: Null & ; echo Void
:570: p2 terminated.

The correct output should be something like:
Null & ; echo Void
:570: :570: p2 terminated.

Your output might be ordered differently, and that's OK, as long as the
child output and the number of prompts (2 of them) is correct.

Parent/child output could get interleaved, but that's still correct behavior.

Three more points were possible here; your total is now 4/4

Some notes about the [odd-looking] correct output:
Your shell was run using: ~cssc0018/Two/p2 < ~cs570/Data2/input1
Due to the above redirection, we do not see any input commands, we only
see what your process outputs.  If you are following the specs, p2 should print
the prompt three times, followed by 'p2 terminated.', so
':570: :570: :570: p2 terminated.' is correct.
The child finishes first and therefore flushes his output buffer first, so the
child output will (usually) appear before the shell prompts in these tests.
...but this is NOT the order you should see when testing your p2 interactively.
NOTE: If your ':570: ' prompt prints the proper NUMBER of times, but is intermixed
with the other output, the autograder should still give you full credit; if not,
the most common reason is inexact punctuation (6 colons AND a period).

Test 11... does your program honor the 'cd' command?
Here is the result of ~cssc0018/Two/p2 < ~cs570/Data2/input2 :

Your output was:
:570: :570: total 0
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 37 Jul 19 10:44 man1
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root  6 Feb 20  2017 man5
:570: p2 terminated.

                                              ERROR    ERROR    ERROR    ERROR
If 'cd' had worked, your program should have launched 'ls' from a new directory,
...and the pipe to 'tr' should have changed to upper-case letters.

Test 15... do backgrounded processes get killed when the shell exits?
NOTE: The following test does NOT work when I run it from a script
(such as my grading script) :-(
This is one of the tests I'll have to run 'by hand' after the due date.
YOU can check if you will pass the test by trying:

 ~cssc0018/Two/p2 < ~cs570/Data2/input5

If you have done things right, you should see jabbersleepy print 'begins sleep'
but it should get killed (by the exiting p2 shell) BEFORE it gets around to
announcing the 'ends sleep' message.
If this happens when you test this, then you're killing background processes OK.

When you do the input5 test 'by hand', pay attention to whether tcsh
reports 'Terminated' (with a capital 'T'); if so, this indicates you do
NOT have the signal-catching stuff working correctly yet.

Since this test has to be run 'by hand', all this script can check is
whether you MIGHT be using killpg() properly:
grep -n 'killpg(' ~/Two/p2.c
83:	killpg(getpgrp(),SIGTERM);

Your stdout contents were:
:570: :570: :570: :570: p2 terminated.
NOTE: examine your error messages below carefully; if you see repeated
messages that you did not expect, this is likely because the parent still had
the error message in its buffer, the forked child inherited this data, and then
both the parent and the child printed it.  You may have trouble reproducing
this effect in your own experiments, but fflush() is what you need to fix it.

Of course, a human will have to judge the quality of your error/warning messages

Three more points were possible here; your total is now 25/32
The assignment will be worth 35 points (after a human grades it).

Test 24... no points, just a way of checking if vertical piping is implemented.
If you have pipelines working, the results of a ps command should be displayed.
Examine the output of the ps command below carefully.  If you are doing vertical
piping correctly, the parent of the 'sleep' process (shown in the PPID coumn)
should be the 'vertical' process, NOT the parent 'p2' process.
If p2, vertical, and sleep report 3 different numbers in the PPID column,
relax -- you're doing things right.

But if both children report p2 as their parent, this is horizontal piping.
The autograder is too dumb to check this effectively, so it may be reporting a
MUCH higher score than is warranted.

If you fail to do vertical piping, it [negatively] affects your grade.  A human
(me) will have to sadly demolish your piping points when I grade the printouts.

One of the 3 processes reported should be the child doing the 'sleep' command.
If you see only two processes in the ps output, perhaps you are [inadvisably]
having one child wait until the grandchild finishes.  Don't do that...

Here is the result of ~cssc0018/Two/p2 < ~cs570/Data2/input16 :

:570: :570: :570: p2 terminated.
NOTE: if you are not seeing any output, this [may] mean that you are INCORRECTLY
having the child wait() for the grandchild.  You should NOT do this --
Only the original parent should be doing any wait()ing.

Your grade for this assignment will be determined by a (human) grader
at the due date.
The automation currently only tests 32 out of the total 35 points;
a human will determine whether you have earned the remaining 3 points,
and if you miss too much stuff on the checklist below, you'll LOSE some points.
(On the automated part, you scored 25/32.)
See the extensive checklist to get an idea of what I will be looking for.
