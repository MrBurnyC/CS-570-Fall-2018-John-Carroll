Here's the promised update on the 'midterm advice' (~cs570/midterm_advice)
for CS570.

We did not quite finish Chapter 3 in the class notes on Thursday; we
stopped a few paragraphs into Page 47, so that's where our midterm
coverage stops for this chapter.  This corresponds to the middle
of Page 209 in Tanenbaum (3rd edition).  So, any questions regarding
the Working Set (3.4.8) or WSCLock (3.4.9) algorithms, or subsequent
Chapter 3 material, may occur on the final, but they will NOT appear
on our midterm.

Page 84 of my notes lists some Tanenbaum questions in Chapter 3 and
Chapter 10 to review for the exam.  ALL these are still relevant,
except for #26 in Chapter 3 (Page 251), which involved the WSClock
algorithm.  And ALL the 'Exercises 3' problems on Pages 83-84 of my
notes are still relevant for next week's exam.

Cheers,
jc
