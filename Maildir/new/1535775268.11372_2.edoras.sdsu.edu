This is a **preliminary** test of your upcoming Program 0.

Due dates for our programs can be found in the ~cs570/calendar file on edoras.

Success on this assignment determines your competency in C, and whether or
not you will be disenrolled from CS570 for lack of prerequisites.

This message, which will appear to be mailed from your account, is intended to
show you the checks that will be made on your assignment when the due date
actually arrives.  This is NOT the actual version that will be graded,
but only an attempt to give you early warning of any potential problems.
Point totals in the final graded version may differ.

[Standard Disclaimer:]
These practice tests are intended to show bugs, but also to reveal places
where you may not be following all the automatic grader's nitpicking
requirements.  If you receive failure warnings on the preliminary tests
and then also have difficulty during the graded event, you have very little
recourse.  To take full advantage of the feedback provided in this course,
you must do the assignments in a timely fashion.

Good, Zero has been created.

Test 1... did you change your finger info and password?
Yes.

Test 2... Checking the contents of your .forward file:
head -20 ~cssc0018/.forward
\cssc0018,
brdcervantes@gmail.com

                                              ERROR    ERROR    ERROR    ERROR
You should have a second address (on a separate line) in .forward as well.
To make the autograder happy, make sure your file is EXACTLY 2 lines long.
One more point was possible here; your total is now 0/1

Test 2... Did you use chsh to change your shell to tcsh?
grep cssc0018 /etc/passwd
cssc0018:x:1129:1007:Bernardo Cervantes,,,6196001753:/home/cs/carroll/cssc0018:/bin/bash
No.  You must change your default shell from bash to tcsh.
Make sure you change your shell (use the 'chsh' command) to /bin/tcsh .
You LOSE a point (for now); your total is now 0/1
One more point was possible here; your total is now 0/2

Test 3... testing will proceed only if you have created the proper file:

16   
17       while ( ( iochar = getchar() ) != EOF )               /* Note 2 */

19       return 0;
20   }

Test 4... is getword.c documented?
(Your getword.c documentation does NOT have to repeat the specs in getword.h,
but it should contain your name, instructor name [NOTE: 'Carroll' contains two
'R's and two 'L's], class (that is, 'CS570'), due date, etc.)
Your comments should help explain what the various parts of your code are doing.
Normally, your comments would be reviewed by a human.  But for this simple
assignment, the autograder merely checks for the class and instructor name.
                                              ERROR    ERROR    ERROR    ERROR
Make sure you have the required documentation data in getword.c.
One point was possible here; your total is now 0/3

Test 5... Does the gradernotes file exist?
ls -lF gradernotes
/bin/ls: cannot access /home/cs/carroll/cssc0018/Zero/gradernotes: No such file or directory

                                              ERROR    ERROR    ERROR    ERROR
You should put your gradernotes file under the Zero directory.
Refer to the assignment for details on what gradernotes should contain.
If you do this at the last minute, you risk misnaming it, and getting no credit.

The autograder is not good at parsing English (no surprise there), so it
will magnanimously award credit for the mere existence of the file -- but note
that there are _two_ MANDATORY statements you MUST include in this file.
Are you SURE you did that?

One more point was possible here; your total is now 0/4

Test 6: Checking all the soft links (calendar, p0 files):
Is the calendar soft link in place?
lrwxrwxrwx 1 cssc0018 carroll 31 Aug 30 10:16 /home/cs/carroll/cssc0018/calendar -> /home/cs/faculty/cs570/calendar
Yes.
Is the getword.h soft link in place?
ls -l ~cssc0018/Zero/getword.h
lrwxrwxrwx 1 cssc0018 carroll 37 Aug 30 12:58 /home/cs/carroll/cssc0018/Zero/getword.h -> /home/cs/faculty/cs570/Zero/getword.h
Yes.
Is the makefile soft link in place?
ls -l ~cssc0018/Zero/makefile
lrwxrwxrwx 1 cssc0018 carroll 36 Aug 30 12:42 /home/cs/carroll/cssc0018/Zero/makefile -> /home/cs/faculty/cs570/Zero/makefile
Yes.
Is the p0.c soft link in place?
ls -l ~cssc0018/Zero/p0.c
lrwxrwxrwx 1 cssc0018 carroll 32 Aug 30 12:50 /home/cs/carroll/cssc0018/Zero/p0.c -> /home/cs/faculty/cs570/Zero/p0.c
Yes.
Unless ALL these are right, you could LOSE a point here; your total is now 0/4

Likewise, your code should compile cleanly, without any serious warning messages
from the compiler:
Test 7... does your program compile?
make clean; make
rm -f *.o p0
gcc -g   -c -o getword.o getword.c
gcc -g   -c -o p0.o p0.c
gcc -o p0 getword.o p0.o

Test 8... does your program handle the simplest situtations?

Your grade for this assignment may be adjusted by a (human) grader at the
due date.  Your grade could be as much as three points lower, depending on what
you have put in gradernotes, the presense of 'serious' compiler warnings, and
the quality of your getword.c documentation.
NOTE: Even if you get subsequent downgrades for things like documentation, that
does NOT put you at risk of disenrollment.  If this autograder score is
8/8, you will NOT be dropped.
Success on this assignment determines your competency in C, and whether or
not you will be disenrolled from CS570 for lack of prerequisites.  You
must have a PERFECT (autograder) score on this assignment to remain enrolled.
